# 0/1 Knapsack Dynamic Programming Visualization

This was done because I just can't visualize it for the longest time. I tried making it in Excel, but that didn't work so here we are. Ultimately the classroom was just not the best environment to slowly visualize it and I just needed to properly sit down and study it, but it has been a fun project and it looked pretty cool, so I can't complain. Special thanks to Geek for Geeks for helping Javatpoint for helping me understand the algorithm.
